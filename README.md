# Car Price Prediction

This project is part of my **AI/ML Internship** with **SmartInternz**. The goal of the project is to predict car prices using a dataset from **Kaggle**. The project is implemented in **Google Colab** using Python and machine learning libraries.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Car Prices Dataset from Kaggle.
- **Goal**: Predict car prices based on features like car model, year, engine type, etc.
- **Tools**: 
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
  - Google Colab

## Steps Involved:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing trends and relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Using `StandardScaler` to scale numerical features.
4. **Model Selection**: Using regression models like **Linear Regression** and evaluating performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Measuring accuracy, R-squared, and other metrics.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Open the `CarPrice_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab**.
3. Upload the **Car Prices Dataset** or download it directly from Kaggle within Colab.
4. Run the notebook to see the car price prediction results.

## Results:
The model predicts car prices with an accuracy of around **X%** based on the dataset and model used.

## Future Improvements:
- Experiment with more advanced models like **Random Forest** or **XGBoost** for better predictions.
- Hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
